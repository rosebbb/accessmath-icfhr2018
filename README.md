# Lecture Video Summarization by Extracting Handwritten Content from Whiteboards

Online lecture videos are a valuable resource for students across the world. The ability to find videos based on their content could make them even more useful. Methods for automatic extraction of this content reduce the amount of manual effort required to make indexing and retrieval of such videos possible. We adapt a deep learning based method for scene text detection, for the purpose of detection of handwritten text, math expressions and sketches in lecture videos.

This code release contains the necessary scripts for lecture video summarization as described in our [paper](https://buffalo.box.com/s/nhjjwpj1j4tlvwc762a65tsimmnyn7d2). The code is distributed under GNU Public License.

This work is a progression of the [AccessMath](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/Software.html#accessmath) Project carried out at [DPRL](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/Projects.html).

## Dependencies

Other main libraries required by our scripts include:
  - Numpy (conda install numpy)
  - OpenCV (with ffmpeg installed for video handling)
  - Scipy (conda install scipy)
  - PyGame (to use the ground truth annotator)
  - Caffe
  - PyTorch (to reproduce entire paper including training) (conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch)

## To reproduce the results in the paper (Table 2):

- Download AccessMath [Dataset](https://buffalo.box.com/s/usa30o2o0oojcslfrkxfyogvbqdedktj) and copy into project root.

- Download our Handwritten Content Detector [model](https://buffalo.box.com/s/elz4wj1favsa24apcjiz0co7ash5qry6) and structure [file](https://buffalo.box.com/s/cb0m7nr1dcmyt9610642yvzncf3ectqd) and place in `models/text_detection`.
  In the structure file (`deploy.prototxt`) make sure to customize paths in the `save_output_param` as required.
```
    save_output_param {
      output_directory: "results/text/longer_conv_300x300/Main"
      output_name_prefix: "comp4_det_test_"
      output_format: "VOC"
      label_map_file: "data/AccessMath/labelmap_accessmath.prototxt"
      num_test_image: 2497
    }
```

- Setup [AccessMath-TextBoxes](https://github.com/bhargavaurala/accessmath-textboxes). If needed, generate training LMDBs.

- Run the following scripts:

-- Export video into still frames for generating training samples for text detector by running 
```
python pre_ST3D_v2.0_00_export_frames.py test_data/databases/db_AccessMath2015.xml -d testing
```
-- Run Text Detection on exported still testing video frames
```
python pre_ST3D_v2.0_01_text_detection.py test_data/databases/db_AccessMath2015.xml -d testing
GPU ID can be set in AccessMath/preprocessing/config/parameters.py GPU_TextDetection (0, by default)
```
-- Run coarse-grained temporal analysis and reconstruction (bringing back occluded content - part 2 of Table 2 - recommended)
```
python pre_ST3D_v2.0_02_td_stability.py test_data/databases/db_AccessMath2015.xml -d testing
python pre_ST3D_v2.0_03_td_bbox_grouping.py test_data/databases/db_AccessMath2015.xml -d testing
python pre_ST3D_v2.0_04_td_ref_binarize.py test_data/databases/db_AccessMath2015.xml -d testing
```
   OR without reconstruction (part 1 of Table 2)
```
python pre_ST3D_v2.0_04_td_raw_binarize.py test_data/databases/db_AccessMath2015.xml -d testing
```
-- Run fine-grained temporal refinement
```
python pre_ST3D_v2.0_05_cc_analysis.py test_data/databases/db_AccessMath2015.xml -d testing
python pre_ST3D_v2.0_06_cc_grouping.py test_data/databases/db_AccessMath2015.xml -d testing
```
-- Run conflict minimization
```
python pre_ST3D_v2.0_07_vid_segmentation.py test_data/databases/db_AccessMath2015.xml -d testing
```
-- Generate final keyframe summaries and evaluation results
```
python pre_ST3D_v2.0_08_generate_summary.py test_data/databases/db_AccessMath2015.xml -d testing
```
-- The final summary keyframes can be found in `output/summaries`

## To retrain handwritten content detector from scratch:

- Download the SSD [model](https://buffalo.box.com/s/3rklcvppkuw63jkp4538nbf6u6gj9zqm) for VOC object class detection and place in `models/person_detection`

- Clone the [SSD PyTorch](https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch) repository and set it up. Add this directory to `$PYTHONPATH`
```
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/ssd.pytorch/:$PYTHONPATH
```

- Run the following scripts:

-- Export video into still frames 
```
python pre_ST3D_v2.0_00_export_frames.py test_data/databases/db_AccessMath2015.xml -d "training, testing"
```
-- Generate person detection bounding boxes on training set and add to annotations
```
python gt_PD_01_detect_speaker.py test_data/databases/db_AccessMath2015.xml -d training
python gt_PD_02_add_speaker_to_annotations.py test_data/databases/db_AccessMath2015.xml -d training
```
-- Generate ground truth annotations by removing text region annotations that are occluded by speaker
```
python pre_ST3D_v2.0_00_export_frames_annotations.py test_data/databases/db_AccessMath2015.xml -d training
```
-- Alternatively, you can download the prepared training data for the Handwritten Content Detector from [here](https://buffalo.box.com/s/6gklgrotfd5drbxvdw2xtrt9i2ldmt01). Download the 3-part zip archive and extract into a folder called AccessMathVOC and place in project root.

-- Generate trained model using the procedure described in [AccessMath-TextBoxes](https://github.com/bhargavaurala/accessmath-textboxes/blob/master/README.md)

-- Follow procedure to reproduce Table 2 starting with `01_text_detection.py` 

## To annotate custom lecture videos:

The annotation tool is run from `gt_annotator.py`. Use it to mark the ideal video segments, select key-frames per segment, and also to label elements on each key-frame. Note that precision tools and interpolation capabilities are provided to make the labeling of moving objects easier as well. 

Usage: `python gt_annotator.py database -l lecture`
Where
        database        = Database metadata file
        lecture         = Lecture video to process
